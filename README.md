Yuchan's Design Studio
----------------------

My design assets warehouse.

My intention is to learn basic of web, mobile app design.

## Photoshop

Photoshop is starting point for web design. At first, I am aiming at master photoshop.
PS has a lot of keybindings to remember like emacs, vim, I wanna be used to composing layers.

## Sketch

I think adobe suites is the greatest tool set. But now illustrator is overkill for me.
Sketch is more suitable for me.
The plugins are written in JavaScript. It sounds good.
